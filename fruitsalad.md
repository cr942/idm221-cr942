# Filipino Fruit Salad
## My NUMBER ONE favorite dessert of ALL TIME! I grew up eating this at family parties, and I knew I had to learn to make it myself. Itâ€™s very easy to make and always hits the spot!

### Ingredients
- 2 large cans of fruit cocktail
- 1 can of mangoes
- 1 can of sliced/diced pineapples
- 1 can of mandarin oranges
- 1 small-medium jar of maraschino cherries
- Sweetened condensed milk
- 1 can (7.5 oz) table cream
- Optional:
    - Lychee
    - Coconut jelly
    - Diced apples

### Directions:
1. Place a large strainer in a large mixing bowl, and pour all of your canned fruits inside. Drain the juices for at least 10 minutes.
2. Pour out the juices (or save them for something else!) and put the fruit back in the mixing bowl.
3. Add in the table cream.
4. Slowly mix in the condensed milk and table cream, tasting repeatedly. This makes the salad very sweet very fast, so only add as much as you like! I prefer about half of a 14 oz can.
5. Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour before eating. Keep it stored in the fridge.
6. Enjoy!
