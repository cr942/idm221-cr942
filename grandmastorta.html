    <h1>Grandma's Torta</h1>
    <h2>A recipe inspired by the torta my grandma would make on busy days where we had no time to cook or eat! Very fulfilling and versatile!</h2>
<!--Ingredients-->
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef or pork</li>
    <li>5 Eggs</li>
    <li>Diced yellow or white onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Banana ketchup (regular ketchup works fine!)</li>
    <li>Pandesal (or any sandwich bread)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
    <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Optional:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Diced potatoes</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cooked rice</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Dice your onion and mince your garlic.</li>
    <li>In a medium-large pan, add in the cooking oil and place over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add in your onion, garlic (and the diced tomato and potato if you’re adding these).</li>
    <li>Add the ground meat to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5-6 minutes until browned.</li>
    <li>Turn off the stove and place everything in the pan into a bowl. Wait until it cools.</li>
    <li>Add your eggs to the bowl, and whisk well.</li>
    <li>In the same pan you used for the meat (or in a different, pancake-sized pan for exactness), add a teaspoon of oil and then pour in about a cup of the mixture -- it should be about the thickness of a pancake if not thinner.</li>
    <li>Cook the egg on medium-low heat for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. The omelette should be golden and crispy.</li>
    <li>Place on a plate with a paper towel.</li>
    <li>Repeat for any remaining batter.</li>
    <li>Add ketchup on the bottom “bun” and arrange into a sandwich.</li>
    <li>You can also eat on top of rice.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
