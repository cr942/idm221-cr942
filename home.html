    <h4>About the Author</h4>
    <p>Hello! My name is Mai! Growing up, my mom and grandma made most of the meals in our house -- but once I got to college, I had to fend for myself! I quickly began to miss homemade food and I didn’t want to rely on just instant ramen and Chic-Fil-A, so I started learning how to cook!
    <p>It’s certainly difficult to cook everything I want since I’m always busy with school and simply don’t have the time or energy to cook a complex meal. Not to mention that grocery prices are ever-increasing, or some things are just not available locally. This website is the perfect hub for college students like me who want to cook quickly and affordably, but also deliciously!</p>
    <p>Many of these recipes I learned just from quick online searches and friends and family, but with slight variations based off my own preferences and ideas. I love to experiment and so I encourage you all to take these recipes and add your own twists to them! Happy cooking!</p>
