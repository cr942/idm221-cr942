Hello! My name is Mai! Growing up, my mom and grandma made most of the meals in our house—but once I got to college, I had to fend for myself! I quickly began to miss homemade food and I didn’t want to rely on just instant ramen and Chick-fil-A, so I started learning how to cook!

It’s certainly difficult to cook everything I want since I’m always busy with school and simply don’t have the time or energy to cook a complex meal. Not to mention that grocery prices are ever-increasing, or some things are just not available locally. This website is the perfect hub for college students like me who want to cook quickly and affordably, but also deliciously!

Many of these recipes I learned just from quick online searches and friends and family, but with slight variations based on my own preferences and ideas. I love to experiment, and so I encourage you all to take these recipes and add your own twists to them! Happy cooking!
