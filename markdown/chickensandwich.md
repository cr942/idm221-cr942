# Cajun Chicken Sandwich
## One of my go-to lunches! For those that are craving a Chic-fil-A or Popeyes sandwich!

### Ingredients
- 1 Chicken Breast
- Cajun seasoning
- Smoked paprika
- Salt & pepper
- Honey
- FLour
- 1 Egg
- Cooking oil
- Sandwich bread
- Optional:
    - Panko bread crumbs
    - Pickles
    - Honey mustard
    - Mayonnaise

### Directions:

1. In separate bowls, put in the flour, whisked eggs, and panko.
2. *If you would like to cook this in an airfryer, skip steps 3 and 7. 
3. In a large pan with some depth, heat oil until it starts to bubble
4. Wash and cut the chicken breast in half, horizontally (to create 2 even filets)
5. Massage your seasonings into the filets
6. Coat the chicken in the flour, the eggs, then the panko (or back into the flour if you arenâ€™t using panko)
7. Put the chicken into the hot oil, and cook on each side for about 3 minutes or until golden brown.
8. *For the airfryer, place coated filets inside and cook for about 10-15 minutes, flipping them halfway through.
9. Place fried chicken on a plate with paper towels or on a rack to drain the excess oil.
10. As soon as you take out the chicken, drizzle honey on top.
11. Arrange your sandwich on the bread with whatever condiments you prefer.
12. Enjoy!
