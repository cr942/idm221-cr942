# Everything Cucumber Salad
## The viral cucumber snack that’s super versatile, but this one is my favorite. Quick and refreshing!

### Ingredients
- 1 cucumber
- Cream cheese
- Smoked or cooked salmon, or tuna (canned tuna works!)

- Optional:
    - Red onions
    - Imitation crab
    - Capers
    - Shrimp
    - Avocado

### Directions:
1. Slice your cucumbers into about half-inch slices (or thinner if you prefer it that way!).
2. If you’re using red onions, half-slice those.
3. Cook and lightly season your salmon with salt and pepper and chop (skip the cooking part if you are using smoked salmon/prefer raw salmon!).
4. Cut the imitation crab into small pieces.
5. Cook the shrimp and cut into small pieces.
6. Peel and dice your avocado.
7. In a medium/large container (with a lid), put in all of your food ingredients.
8. Add about a tablespoon scoop of cream cheese into the container.
9. Add in any additional ingredients (red onions, capers, etc.).
10. Generously season with your seasonings of choice.
11. Put on the lid and shake until everything is evenly mixed.
12. Open and enjoy!
