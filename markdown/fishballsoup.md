# Misua Fishball Soup
## Cold weather is approaching, so this dish will keep you warm! This is one of the most recent recipes I learned and it’s very easy and yummy!

### Ingredients
- 1-2 pounds chicken
- Misua noodles (or any long, thin noodle like angel hair)
- 6 cups chicken broth (or 6 chicken bouillon cubes with 6 cups of water)
- Frozen fishballs
- 1 white or yellow onion
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Optional:
    - Green onions or scallions

### Directions:
1. Dice the onion.
2. Wash and cut the chicken into strips and lightly season with salt and pepper.
3. In a medium-large pan, add in vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
4. Cook for about 6 minutes, then remove from the pan, placing chicken in a bowl.
5. In the same pan, cook the onion until soft.
6. In a large pot, boil chicken broth (or 6 cups of water and 6 bouillon cubes) on medium-low heat.
7. Add in fishballs and onion.
8. Mix in fish sauce. You can add more to taste, but be careful—fish sauce is extremely strong!
9. Add in chicken.
10. Add the noodles.
11. Cover the pot and let it cook for about 2-3 minutes or until the noodles are soft (misua is very thin so it cooks very fast!).
12. Pour into a bowl and garnish with chopped green onion.
13. Enjoy!
