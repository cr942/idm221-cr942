# Grandma's Torta
## A recipe inspired by the torta my grandma would make on busy days where we had no time to cook or eat! Very fulfilling and versatile!

### Ingredients
- 1 pound ground beef or pork
- 5 eggs
- Diced yellow or white onion
- Garlic
- Banana ketchup (regular ketchup works fine!)
- Pandesal (or any sandwich bread)
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Optional:
    - Diced potatoes
    - Diced tomatoes
    - Cooked rice

### Directions:
1. Dice your onion and mince your garlic.
2. In a medium-large pan, add in the cooking oil and place over medium heat.
3. Add in your onion, garlic (and the diced tomato and potato if you’re adding these).
4. Add the ground meat to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5-6 minutes until browned.
5. Turn off the stove and place everything in the pan into a bowl. Wait until it cools.
6. Add your eggs to the bowl, and whisk well.
7. In the same pan you used for the meat (or in a different, pancake-sized pan for exactness), add a teaspoon of oil and then pour in about a cup of the mixture—it should be about the thickness of a pancake if not thinner.
8. Cook the egg on medium-low heat for about 2-3 minutes.
9. Flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. The omelette should be golden and crispy.
10. Place on a plate with a paper towel.
11. Repeat for any remaining batter.
12. Add ketchup on the bottom “bun” and arrange into a sandwich.
13. You can also eat on top of rice.
14. Enjoy!
