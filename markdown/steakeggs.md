# Steak & Eggs
## We tend to think steak means expensive and extravagant, but here we will utilize a cheap cut of steak and turn it into something yummy! And takes no time to make.

### Ingredients:
- Thin cut sirloin (or the cheapest cut you can find!)
- Eggs
- Vegetable oil
- Salt & pepper
- Garlic salt
- Paprika
- 1 tablespoon butter
- **Optional:**
  - Avocado

### Directions:
1. Cut the steak into half-inch thick slices.
2. Rub the seasonings and a teaspoon of vegetable oil into the steak.
3. In a medium-large pan, heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil on medium-high heat.
4. Add the steak pieces and cook for about 5 minutes, flipping halfway through, until a nice crust forms.
5. Turn down the heat to medium-low and add the butter to the pan.
6. Carefully tilt the pan so that a pool of butter forms on one side. Let it melt, and then using a spoon, baste both sides of the steak for about 2-3 minutes.
7. Transfer the steak onto a plate and let it rest for about 10 minutes.
8. While waiting, fry the eggs in the same pan as the steak, lightly seasoning with salt and pepper.
9. Peel and cut the avocado into slices or dice, then season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil on top.
10. Arrange neatly on a plate and enjoy!
