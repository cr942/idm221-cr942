    <h1>Homemade Mozzarella Sticks</h1>
    <h2>For those craving mozzarella sticks -- they’re actually super easy to make!</h2>
<!--Ingredients-->
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mozzarella (sticks or block)</li>
        <li>Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2-4 eggs</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
<!--Directions-->
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In separate bowls, pour in your panko, flour, and eggs</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, and lightly season the panko and flour with Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>For those with a mozzarella block, cut into about one-inch thick pieces -- however many you’d like to make!</li>
        <li>Dip your mozzarella in the flour, eggs, then the panko.</li>
        <li>Repeat, double dipping them to ensure the sticks are thickly coated (or else the cheese will completely melt out!)</li>
        <li>Place on a baking sheet and place your sticks in the freezer. If you don’t plan on frying them right away, place them in a sealed, freezer-safe container</li>
        <li>In a large pan with some depth, pour in your vegetable oil (enough to coat half a mozzarella stick) and wait until it’s hot enough to fry (I typically wait until it starts to bubble).</li>
        <li>Once your oil is hot and ready, take your mozzarella sticks out the freezer and place them in the oil.</li>
        <li>Fry each side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove any excess oil with a paper towel on a plate (the simplest way), or a rack if you have one</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
