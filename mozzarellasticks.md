# Homemade Mozzarella Sticks
## For those craving mozzarella sticks—they’re actually super easy to make!

### Ingredients:
- Mozzarella (sticks or block)
- Panko bread crumbs
- 2-4 eggs
- Italian seasoning
- Salt
- Flour
- Vegetable oil

### Directions:
1. In separate bowls, pour in your panko, flour, and eggs.
2. Whisk the eggs, and lightly season the panko and flour with Italian seasoning.
3. For those with a mozzarella block, cut into about one-inch thick pieces—however many you’d like to make!
4. Dip your mozzarella in the flour, eggs, then the panko.
5. Repeat, double dipping them to ensure the sticks are thickly coated (or else the cheese will completely melt out!).
6. Place on a baking sheet and put your sticks in the freezer. If you don’t plan on frying them right away, place them in a sealed, freezer-safe container.
7. In a large pan with some depth, pour in your vegetable oil (enough to coat half a mozzarella stick) and wait until it’s hot enough to fry (I typically wait until it starts to bubble).
8. Once your oil is hot and ready, take your mozzarella sticks out of the freezer and place them in the oil.
9. Fry each side until golden brown.
10. Remove any excess oil with a paper towel on a plate (the simplest way), or a rack if you have one.
11. Enjoy!
