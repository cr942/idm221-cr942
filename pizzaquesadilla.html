    <h1>Pizza Quesadilla</h1>
    <h2>This one is super fun to make! If you could eat a pizza but don’t want to order a whole one, this recipe is for you!</h2>
<!--Ingredients-->
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Medium-large tortilla (corn or flour, up to you! I prefer flour)</li>
    <li>Pepperoni</li>
    <li>Shredded/grated mozzarella</li>
    <li>Shredded/grated parmesan</li>
    <li>Oregano</li>
    <li>Salt & pepper</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Optional:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Shredded/grated provolone</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pan, add a teaspoon of olive oil and apply to medium heat.</li>
    <li>Prepare your tortilla by cutting it down the middle, stopping at the center (just cut it halfway, not all the way!).</li>
    <li>Add the pepperonis and cook for about 1-2 minutes until they’ve absorbed enough oil and are slightly crispy.</li>
    <li>Take out the pepperonis and drain on a paper towel if needed.</li>
    <li>Place the tortilla in the pan, then flip until that one side is warm.</li>
    <li>Arrange your cheese and pepperoni on each quarter of the tortilla, starting with pepperoni at the cut.</li>
    <li>Season lightly with oregano, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Starting at the cut you made, carefully fold the tortilla into the next quarter. Continue to fold along the tortilla until you have just one, layered quarter.</li>
    <li>Flip the tortilla and continue to cook until each side is golden and crispy, and the cheeses are all melted.</li>
    <li>Prepare your marinara sauce in a small dish.</li>
    <li>Enjoy by dipping your pizza quesadilla into the marinara!</li>
</ol>
