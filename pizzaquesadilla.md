# Pizza Quesadilla
## This one is super fun to make! If you could eat a pizza but don’t want to order a whole one, this recipe is for you!

### Ingredients:
- Medium-large tortilla (corn or flour, up to you! I prefer flour)
- Pepperoni
- Shredded/grated mozzarella
- Shredded/grated parmesan
- Oregano
- Salt & pepper
- Olive oil
- Optional:
    - Shredded/grated provolone
    - Marinara sauce

### Directions:
1. In a large pan, add a teaspoon of olive oil and apply to medium heat.
2. Prepare your tortilla by cutting it down the middle, stopping at the center (just cut it halfway, not all the way!).
3. Add the pepperonis and cook for about 1-2 minutes until they’ve absorbed enough oil and are slightly crispy.
4. Take out the pepperonis and drain on a paper towel if needed.
5. Place the tortilla in the pan, then flip until that one side is warm.
6. Arrange your cheese and pepperoni on each quarter of the tortilla, starting with pepperoni at the cut.
7. Season lightly with oregano, salt, and pepper to taste.
8. Starting at the cut you made, carefully fold the tortilla into the next quarter. Continue to fold along the tortilla until you have just one, layered quarter.
9. Flip the tortilla and continue to cook until each side is golden and crispy, and the cheeses are all melted.
10. Prepare your marinara sauce in a small dish.
11. Enjoy by dipping your pizza quesadilla into the marinara!
