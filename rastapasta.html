    <h1>Rasta Pasta</h1>
    <h2>A recipe my boyfriend first cooked for me and we’ve been obsessed ever since! This dish is also quite versatile! If you’re looking to make a tasty pasta without simmering sauce all day (or just love white sauce pasta), this dish is perfect for you!</h2>
<!--Ingredients-->
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 chicken breast</li>
    <li>Penne pasta (or any pasta of choice)</li>
    <li>3 bell peppers (I like to get red, green, and yellow!)</li>
    <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>Sesame oil and/or butter</li>
    <li>Cajun seasoning</li>
    <li>Smoked paprika (regular paprika works!)</li>
    <li>Poultry/all-purpose seasoning (I prefer Adobo)</li>
    <li>Shredded/grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<!--Directions-->
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start boiling water in advance while you cook!</li>
    <li>Slice chicken breast and peppers into small strips.</li>
    <li>In a large pan with some depth, add a tablespoon of sesame oil/butter (I like to go half-and-half with both!) and wait until hot/melted.</li>
    <li>Add in your chicken and lightly season with all of the seasonings. Emphasize lightly, because we want all the flavor to be in our sauce -- otherwise, it will turn out very salty. Cook evenly for about 5-6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add your pasta of choice to the boiling water and cook until al-dente (or to your preference).</li>
    <li>Remove the chicken from the pan, then add in the peppers. Cook until they are slightly softened.</li>
    <li>Add in heavy cream -- enough to coat the peppers. You can pour in more depending on how much sauce you’d like!</li>
    <li>Add in about a cup of parmesan and mix until the sauce thickens up. You can continue to add more cheese until it reaches a creamy consistency.</li>
    <li>Drain the pasta, leaving a little bit of pasta water, and then pour it into your sauce. Mix evenly.</li>
    <li>Finally, add in your chicken strips and mix everything together.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
