        <li>1-2 eggs</li>
        <li>Cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>

<!--Directions-->
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and cook 1 cup of rice (1 cup per serving).</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix in brown sugar, soy sauce, and mirin. Add as much soy sauce and mirin in an even ratio to how much spam you are cooking/how much sauce you would like! (I prefer to have a glaze instead of full-on sauce).</li>
        <li>Slice the spam into half-inch thick strips (or you can dice them).</li>
        <li>Add cooking spray to a medium-sized pan and place on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Throw in your spam pieces and cook evenly for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour your sauce mixture into the pan with the spam, and mix to coat it evenly. Let it cook for about another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare a bowl of cooked rice and mix in furikake seasoning.</li>
        <li>Take out the spam and place it on top of the rice. Drizzle any excess sauce from the pan on top (or you can save it for the eggs).</li>
        <li>In the same pan (or a separate pan if you donâ€™t want the sauce in your eggs/are saving the sauce for on top), fry your eggs until they are cooked to your preference.</li>
        <li>Place the eggs on top of your spam.</li>
        <li>Enjoy by itself or with sushi nori!</li>
    </ol>
