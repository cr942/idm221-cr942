# Spam, Eggs, & Rice
## This is my favorite thing to eat and not just for breakfast! In this recipe, we are making plain spam into something great and tasty!

### Ingredients:
- Spam
- 1-2 eggs
- Cooked rice
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- **Optional:**
  - Furikake seasoning
  - Sushi nori

### Directions:
1. Wash and cook 1 cup of rice (1 cup per serving).
2. In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, soy sauce, and mirin. Adjust the amounts based on how much spam you are cooking; I prefer a glaze instead of a full sauce.
3. Slice the spam into half-inch thick strips (or dice them).
4. Add cooking spray to a medium-sized pan and heat over medium.
5. Add your spam pieces and cook evenly for about 3 minutes.
6. Pour your sauce mixture into the pan with the spam, and mix to coat evenly. Let it cook for another 2 minutes.
7. Prepare a bowl of cooked rice and mix in furikake seasoning.
8. Place the cooked spam on top of the rice and drizzle any excess sauce from the pan over it (or save it for the eggs).
9. In the same pan (or a separate one if you want to keep the sauce out of your eggs), fry your eggs to your preference.
10. Place the eggs on top of the spam.
11. Enjoy by itself or with sushi nori!
