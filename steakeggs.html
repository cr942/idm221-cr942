    <h1>Steak & Eggs</h1>
    <h2>We tend to think steak means expensive and extravagant, but here we will utilize a cheap cut of steak and turn it into something yummy! And takes no time to make.</h2>
<!--Ingredients-->
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Thin cut sirloin (or the cheapest cut you can find!)</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic salt</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Optional:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Avocado</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
<!--Directions-->
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the steak into half-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>Rub the seasonings and a teaspoon of vegetable oil into the steak.</li>
        <li>In a medium-large pan, heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the steak pieces and cook for about 5 minutes, flipping halfway through, until a nice crust forms.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to medium-low and add the butter to the pan.</li>
        <li>Carefully tilt the pan so that a pool of butter forms on one side. Let it melt, and then using a spoon, baste both sides of the steak for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the steak onto a plate and let it rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While waiting, fry the eggs in the same pan as the steak, lightly seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut the avocado into slices or dice, then season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil on top.</li>
        <li>Arrange neatly on a plate and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
